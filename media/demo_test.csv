"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase.
"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!"
"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family

"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.."
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
